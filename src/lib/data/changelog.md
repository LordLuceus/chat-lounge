# ChatLounge Changelog

## 30 Apr, 2025

Added voice settings to the advanced TTS settings dialog. You can now adjust the speed, stability, and other ElevenLabs settings for the selected voice.

Also added a sorting panel to the conversations, agents, and folders pages.

## 29 Apr, 2025

The conversation import eature is now out of beta. Also added a load all messages button alongside the load more button.

## 16 Mar, 2025

Added folders. You can now organize your conversations into folders, making it easier to find and manage them. Start by creating a new folder on the folders page. You can then add conversations to the folder by clicking the "Add to folder" button in the conversation menu. Hope you enjoy the new feature! ðŸš€

## 6 Feb, 2025

Added support for Google's new Gemini 2.0 Flash model. You can set your Google API key in the settings page and start chatting with Gemini 2.0 Flash right away!

## 2 Feb, 2025

Added the ability to pin conversations to the top of the list, making them easier to find. You can pin a conversation by clicking the "Pin to top" option in the conversation menu. Also added support for OpenAI's reasoning models: O3 Mini, O1, and O1 Mini. Enjoy! ðŸš€

## 25 Jan, 2025

Added the ability to edit a message without regenerating the AI's response. This is useful for fixing typos and other minor edits.

## 17 Jan, 2025

Fixed public pages, like shared conversations, so they're actually, you know, public. Whoops. ðŸ˜…

## 1 Jan, 2025

Added support for Anthropic's Claude 3.5 family of models. You can set your API key in the settings page and start chatting with Anthropic models right away! Happy New Year!

## 29 Dec, 2024

We now only load the most recent 20 messages when you navigate to a conversation. This will improve performance for long threads. You can load older messages by clicking the "load more" button at the top of the chat list. We've also fixed a bug where the search query for conversations was not working correctly.

## 24 Dec, 2024

Shared conversations are here! ðŸŽ‰ You can now share conversations with other users. Just click the Share button in the conversation menu, and the share link will be copied to your clipboard. You can then share the link with anyone you want. Anyone with the link will be able to continue the conversation from where you left off (each user will have their own, separate copy of the conversation). Note that shared conversations do not update as you add new messages to the original conversation, i.e. they are fixed at the point of creation. This will be addressed in a future update, but for now you can unshare and reshare the conversation to update it.

You can view conversations you've shared in the new My shared conversations page, which you can access from the user dropdown menu.

We hope you enjoy the new updates. Let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions! Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ…

## 12 Dec, 2024

Fixed a bug where the greeting message remained even if deleted.

## 1 Dec, 2024

We've added a rewind conversation feature. This allows you to rewind the conversation to a specific message, deleting all messages beyond that point. Also, you can now send an empty message and the AI will continue the conversation from that point.

## 25 Nov, 2024

This release brings some major, though mostly under-the-hood, changes to the app.

- Migrated the app to a self-hosted server and a local database. In practice, this should make the app feel much snappier in many cases. As this is a major change, please let us know if you encounter any issues.
- Added a feature to import a chat. This requires a JSON file structured like the one exported by the app. The import will be queued and processed in the background, though in most cases it will take only a few seconds to complete. You can check the progress of the import in the conversations page. This feature is still in beta and may have some issues, so please report any problems you encounter.
- The language model is no longer locked in once you start a conversation. You can now switch between models at any time, and the conversation will continue using the new model. This should make it easier to experiment with different models and see how they perform.
- Updated GPT 4O to the latest snapshot, 2024-11-20.

## 7 Nov, 2024

Added an option to export a chat as JSON and fixed an issue with model selection.

## 4 Nov, 2024

Added basic support for characters. Characters are another type of agent optimised for chatting with characters, real or fictional. You can create a character just like a standard agent, but with a few additional features. The greeting field allows you to add an initial message that will be used as the first message in any new chat with the character. Also, you can use the {{user}} and {{char}} placeholders in your instructions to refer to the user and the character, respectively. These will automatically be replaced with the appropriate names when the character is used in a chat. We expect to add more features to characters in the future, so don't hesitate to let us know if you have any suggestions!

In addition, we've added a feature to export chats as plain text, allowing you to easily share your conversations with others. Simply click the "Export chat" button in the chat window to download a text file containing all the messages in the conversation. Enjoy! ðŸš€

## 4 Sep, 2024

Per user request, we now remove any code blocks from the text before generating TTS.

## 15 Aug, 2024

Fixed a bug where editing a message other than the last one in a conversation would result in strange behaviour, such as the new message being appended to the end of the conversation instead of replacing the old message.

## 13 Aug, 2024

We've added a new page where you can freely generate speech with your own text using ElevenLabs without being tied to a conversation with a language model.

## 11 Aug, 2024

We've added an advanced TTS settings dialog. For now, you can select the ElevenLabs model you wish to use. Turbo V2 is still the default if you don't select a different model, but when you do, your selection is remembered until you change it. More options coming soon. Happy chatting!

## 10 Aug, 2024

We've rolled out a potential fix for the issue where the Google provider occasionally does not generate a conversation title.

## 7 Aug, 2024

We've added a TTS history page. You can now play, download, and delete TTS history items. You can find the page in the new TTS section of the navigation menu. Enjoy!

## 1 Aug, 2024

We removed the soon-to-be-deprecated Mistral AI models, mistral-small and mistral-medium, and added the new gpt-4o-mini model. We also fixed a few bugs related to deleting conversations and agents. In addition, we added a popup that notifies you when the app has been updated.

On a side note, ElevenLabs recently released their new Turbo v2.5 model. However, after careful evaluation, we've decided not to switch to it by default as it actually makes some voices sound worse. We'll keep the Turbo v2 model for now, but we'll add a setting to switch between models in the future.

## 12 Jun, 2024

We've added support for Google's Gemini models, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro. You can set your Google API key in the settings page just like the other providers. Note that, if you're in Europe, you'll need to have a paid account to use the Gemini models. Happy chatting! ðŸš€

## 2 Jun, 2024

We've added agent sharing to ChatLounge. You can now share agents with other users, allowing them to use your agent in their conversations. You can make your agents visible to all users or shareable by a link. We've also fixed some bugs around creating new conversations and TTS. Enjoy!

## 1 May, 2024

This release brings the long-awaited conversation history feature. You can now view and search your past conversations with the AI. The agents page has also received a facelift, making it easier to manage your agents. We've also added a new keyboard shortcut, Shift + Escape, to focus the chat input. In addition, we've made several improvements and bug fixes to enhance your ChatLounge experience, including a general performance boost. Happy chatting! ðŸš€

## 7 Apr, 2024

- Added agents. You can now create custom AI agents with specific personalities and characteristics. Support for agent sharing is coming soon.

- Fixed a bug where TTS would not work on Firefox. We fall back to non-streaming TTS in this case, which will be slower but still functional.
- Fixed a bug where pressing enter in the chat input would not send the message in Firefox.

## 16 Mar, 2024

- Added the ability to select a model and voice for the AI to use. This allows for customisation of the AI's voice and behaviour.
