# ChatLounge Changelog

## 2 Jun, 2024

We've added agent sharing to ChatLounge. You can now share agents with other users, allowing them to use your agent in their conversations. You can make your agents visible to all users or shareable by a link. We've also fixed some bugs around creating new conversations and TTS. Enjoy!

## 1 May, 2024

This release brings the long-awaited conversation history feature. You can now view and search your past conversations with the AI.

In addition, we've made several improvements and bug fixes to enhance your ChatLounge experience, including a general performance boost. Happy chatting! ðŸš€
