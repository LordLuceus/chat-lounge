# ChatLounge Changelog

## 4 Sep, 2024

Per user request, we now remove any code blocks from the text before generating TTS.

## 15 Aug, 2024

Fixed a bug where editing a message other than the last one in a conversation would result in strange behaviour, such as the new message being appended to the end of the conversation instead of replacing the old message.

## 13 Aug, 2024

We've added a new page where you can freely generate speech with your own text using ElevenLabs without being tied to a conversation with a language model.

## 11 Aug, 2024

We've added an advanced TTS settings dialog. For now, you can select the ElevenLabs model you wish to use. Turbo V2 is still the default if you don't select a different model, but when you do, your selection is remembered until you change it. More options coming soon. Happy chatting!

## 10 Aug, 2024

We've rolled out a potential fix for the issue where the Google provider occasionally does not generate a conversation title.

## 7 Aug, 2024

We've added a TTS history page. You can now play, download, and delete TTS history items. You can find the page in the new TTS section of the navigation menu. Enjoy!

## 1 Aug, 2024

We removed the soon-to-be-deprecated Mistral AI models, mistral-small and mistral-medium, and added the new gpt-4o-mini model. We also fixed a few bugs related to deleting conversations and agents. In addition, we added a popup that notifies you when the app has been updated.

On a side note, ElevenLabs recently released their new Turbo v2.5 model. However, after careful evaluation, we've decided not to switch to it by default as it actually makes some voices sound worse. We'll keep the Turbo v2 model for now, but we'll add a setting to switch between models in the future.

## 12 Jun, 2024

We've added support for Google's Gemini models, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro. You can set your Google API key in the settings page just like the other providers. Note that, if you're in Europe, you'll need to have a paid account to use the Gemini models. Happy chatting! ðŸš€

## 2 Jun, 2024

We've added agent sharing to ChatLounge. You can now share agents with other users, allowing them to use your agent in their conversations. You can make your agents visible to all users or shareable by a link. We've also fixed some bugs around creating new conversations and TTS. Enjoy!

## 1 May, 2024

This release brings the long-awaited conversation history feature. You can now view and search your past conversations with the AI. The agents page has also received a facelift, making it easier to manage your agents. We've also added a new keyboard shortcut, Shift + Escape, to focus the chat input. In addition, we've made several improvements and bug fixes to enhance your ChatLounge experience, including a general performance boost. Happy chatting! ðŸš€
